# CCC RATING CALCULATIONS
---
dedicated to andy who does not get up at 7am to do codeforces
and so i get a bunch of data, combine them, do some math on it, to get unofficial ratings

Rating calculations are based on the Atcoder Rating System.

| ------------------------ | ----------- | ---- |
| Codeforces Div 1         | 9999 | Similar to AGC     |
| Codeforces Div 2         | 2800 | Similar to ARC     |
| Codeforces Div 3         | 1600 | cf1600 is around ac-1200 |
| Codeforces Div 4         | 1200 | cf1200 is around ac-900  |
| Atcoder Grand Contest    | 9999 | |
| Atcoder Regular Contest  | 2800 | |
| Atcoder Beginner Contest | 2000 | |

### Folders
- `data` - raw data, json from codeforces and atcoder API
- `ndata` - lookup data (atcoder)
- `fdata` - formatted data (takes in `data` and `ndata` and dumps it here, to be processed by some c++ probably?)
- `extra` - extra data (formatted), "unofficial standings" that are mixed with `fdata` to get results
